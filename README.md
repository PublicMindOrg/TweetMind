# TweetMind

TweetMind is a project that analyzes public issues and gives a biased public overview on daily global crisis. We started with 5 topics, Academic Workers Strike,Climate Change,Russia Ukraine War,Layoffs and Gun Violence. These are stored in a json file as a list of objects. The object contains the seed term and the topic. We have a dashboard where a user can see the analysis and certain endpoints for collecting tweets, storing them in the database, converting database-fetched tweeets to a dataframe, deduplication of tweets
